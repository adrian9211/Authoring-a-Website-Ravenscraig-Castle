          1460. The ruins straddle a high triangular-shaped promontory overlooking the Firth of Forth. The principal buildings, facing landward, comprise two lofty drum towers flanking a central block housing the main entrance. Behind it lie foundations of ancillary structures and defensive walls. The castle is noted for its array of gunholes. </p>

          <p>James II acquired the lands of Ravenscraig Castle in 1460. Work immediately began on the construction of a residence for his wife, Queen Mary of Gueldres.<br> 

            The king was involved with the planning but, ironically, was killed in a tragic accident with a loaded cannon at the Siege of Roxburgh Castle near Floors Castle in the Scottish Borders. Construction was commenced around 1460 by his widow, Mary of Guelders, as a memorial to him and as a dower house. Mary of Guelders lived in the castle until her death in 1463.<br> 
            
            Ownership passed to her son James III (reigned 1460-1488) but in 1471 he gave the castle to William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Caithness in exchange for the Earldom of Orkney and associated lands which James annexed from Norway to the Scottish Crown. After 1471 Ravenscraig was finally completed by the Sinclairs.<br>

          During the 1650-51 invasion of Scotland by English forces under Oliver Cromwell, Ravenscraig was invaded, attacked and damaged. The castle remained in the ownership of the Sinclairs, who built nearby Dysart House (1755-1756) on the estate, and later passed to the St Clair-Erskines, Earls of Rosslyn. The estate and castle remained in the family until sold in 1896, by the 5th Earl, to linoleum magnate Sir Michael Nairn who lived in Dysart House. <br>

          The castle was used as an ammunition depot during the First World War. In 1929, 85 acres (34 ha) of the estate, including the castle, was given to the town of   Kirkcaldy by the Nairn family as a public park. Ravenscraig Castle was passed into state care in 1955 and has been open to the public by the owners Historic   Scotland since 1971. It is now managed by Historic Scotland and is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. <br>

          <p>Ravenscraig Castle has little associative values, either personal or with historical events. The name Sinclair lives on in the nearby suburb of Sinclairtown. <br>

            The name Ravenscraig is more commonly associated locally with Ravenscraig Park, a large and popular recreational amenity spreading eastward to Dysart. (Ravenscraig Park was gifted to the people of Kirkcaldy in 1929 by Michael Nairn, the linoleum magnate, who resided at Dysart House, formerly a Sinclair property.) The three 1960s tower blocks that overwhelm the castle from the north are also called Ravens Craig. <br>
            
            The castle is presently managed as a visitor attraction by Fife Council, with Historic Scotland retaining responsibility for its maintenance. The property is freely accessible from Ravenscraig Park. However, the interiors of the two towers and artillery platform are normally locked. The site has a history of vandalism and anti-social behaviour, and even though Historic Scotland used to employ custodians, they were more akin to a security guard than a visitor services manager. Today, the two towers are the almost exclusive domain of nesting fulmars. <br>
            
            The castle is close to the Fife Coastal Path (part of the North Sea trail) that runs through Ravenscraig Park.<br>

          Ravenscraig Castle probably had a chapel or oratory during its time as a noble residence, though where in the complex it was located is not known. <br> <br>

          The castle has no known spiritual associations or meanings today. <br>

            Ravenscraig is a small castle, built on a narrow rocky promontory in the Firth of Forth. It is naturally defended on three sides by steep cliffs dropping to the sea, and the main part of the castle forms the northern, landward, defence. This comprises two D-plan towers, with outer walls 4.25 metres (13.9 ft) thick, designed to withstand cannon fire. Battlements between the towers formed an artillery platform, with gun holes pointing to landward. The whole is defended by a deep, rock-cut ditch, and is accessed via a bridge. <br>

          Ravenscraig Castle Layout. The shape of the castle was dictated by the terrain but it in essence it is similar to any Tower House, i.e. a central tower with the Great Hall and VIP accommodation (in this case the West Tower) whilst the rest of the domestic and ancillary buildings are enclosed within a barmkin. <br>
